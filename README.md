# 📊 Social Media Engagement Data Analysis  

This project is based on the  
[📂 Social Media Engagement Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyaraj2006/social-media-engagement).  

It explores **audience engagement across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter in 2023**, analyzing how likes, comments, and shares vary with platform, post type, sentiment, and timing.

## 🌍 Overview  

The dataset captures the pulse of **viral social media trends**, including:  
- Popular hashtags and content types  
- User engagement levels (likes, comments, shares)  
- Platform-specific behaviors

   - Compared engagement across **images, videos, and text posts**  
   - Analyzed sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) vs. engagement  
   - Studied posting time effects (days/months)  

3. **Visualization**
